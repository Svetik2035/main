        In this assignment you will write a program to create a shopping list, count and prices.

        Please read carefully! If you do not fully understand the requirement ask your classmates in Slack or ask your instructor!

                You will use Scanner object and ask user to enter 3 items followed by its count, price and you will calculate total price and show as a report.*/

               // String  Item1, Item2, Item3, report;
            //    int  count1, count2, count3;
        //double  price1, price2, price3, totalPrice;


        //Create a Scanner object named scan.
               // Execution flow using with example:

       // Use scanner to read all 3 values.
       /* Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter Item1, count and its price:");

        Item1 = scan.next();
        count1 = scan.nextInt();
        price1 = scan.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter Item2, count and its price:");

        Item2 = scan.next();
        count2 = scan.nextInt();
        price2 = scan.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter Item3, count and its price:");

        Item3 = scan.next();
        count3 = scan.nextInt();
        price3 = scan.nextDouble();

      /*  double totalPrice1 = price1* count1;
        double totalPrice2 = price1* count1;
        double totalPrice3 = price1* count1;

        /*total Price = Total





        -calculate totalPrice for all items only if the item's count is more than 0!

                -build the report variable by concatenating Strings and double price values:
        -do not include items that have count 0, use if statement !
                -Calculate total price for the item and concatenate like below

        "Item1: Tomatoes Price: 10.8, Item3: Apples Price: 31.5"
        Explanation: (Item2 "Cheese" is not included since its count is 0)

        - Print the value of report variable

                - Print total Price:
        "Total price: 42.3"*/
