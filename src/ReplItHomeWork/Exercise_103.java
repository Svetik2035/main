         * nstructions from your teacher:
         * Assume that the int variables i and j have been declared, and that n has been declared and initialized.
         * Using for loops (you may need more than one), write code that will cause a triangle of asterisks of size n to be output to the screen.
         *
         * Example:
         * input: 5
         * output: *
         * output: **
         * output: ***
         * output: ****
         * output: *****
         *
         * Example:
         * input: 3
         * output: *
         * output: **
         * output: ***
